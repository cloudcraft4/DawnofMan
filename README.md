# Dawn of Man

This is the pre-Alpha version of my roguelike game (which I am making purely for my own enjoyment).

The "bare-bones" of this game are based on open source software by many different authors.  As time goes along it will be more and more my own creation.

The game required Python 3.5 or higher and is using the TCOD and LIBTCODPY modules.
