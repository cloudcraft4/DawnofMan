# Dawn of Man

This is the pre-Alpha version of my roguelike game (which I am making purely for my own enjoyment).

Simply run "engine.py" to start the game.

The game required Python 3.5 or higher and is using the TCOD and LIBTCODPY modules.

Tile set is taken from the DawnLike Tileset and is created by DawnBringer.  It is covered by the CC-BY 4.0 license.
